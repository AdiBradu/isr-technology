<br>
###Whatâ€™s the difference between CCTV & IP?<br>
<br>
An IP camera is a digital video camera which transmits data via an Ethernet cable, or wiresless link, also known as Internet Protocol. The video signals are then sent to an NVR (network video recorder) for storage. IP cameras provide better security and a number of features than traditional CCTV security camera systems.<br>
<br>
A CCTV Camera or closed-circuit television is a type of analog video camera. This type of camera transmits video signals over coaxial cable back to a DVR (digital video recorder) Unlike IP cameras CCTV can only use a wired connection. The network of CCTV cameras makes up a complete security system and the signals are not publicly distributed to outside receivers.<br>
